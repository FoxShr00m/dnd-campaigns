### Aetherborn

The Aetherborn are a unique race in the Shattered Archipelago, embodying the fusion of elemental magic and advanced technology. They are descendants of the ancient guardians of the Aether Heart, possessing innate abilities to manipulate both magical and technological forces.

#### Physical Description

Aetherborn typically have a humanoid appearance with distinct elemental and technological features. Their skin often has a faint, iridescent glow, and their eyes can shimmer with elemental energy. Some Aetherborn have intricate patterns of glowing circuitry across their bodies, while others may display more overt elemental traits, such as hair that resembles flowing water, skin that looks like stone, or veins that crackle with lightning.

#### Aetherborn Traits

**Ability Score Increase:** Your Intelligence increases by 2, and your Dexterity or Wisdom increases by 1.

**Age:** Aetherborn mature at the same rate as humans but have a slightly extended lifespan, living up to 150 years.

**Alignment:** Aetherborn can be of any alignment, but their innate connection to the balance of elemental forces often inclines them towards neutrality.

**Size:** Aetherborn are about the same size and build as humans. Your size is Medium.

**Speed:** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**Languages:** You can speak, read, and write Common and Aetheric, a language that combines ancient magical runes with advanced technical scripts.

**Aetheric Affinity:** Choose one of the following elemental affinities: Air, Earth, Fire, or Water. You gain resistance to the chosen element's damage type (Air = Lightning, Earth = Acid, Fire = Fire, Water = Cold).

**Elemental Manipulation:** You know one cantrip of your choice from the following list: _gust_ (Air), _mold earth_ (Earth), _control flames_ (Fire), or _shape water_ (Water). Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for this cantrip.

**Technomancy:** You have proficiency with tinker's tools and can use them to repair damaged technological devices. Additionally, you can spend 1 hour and 10 gp worth of materials to create a tiny device (AC 5, 1 hp) that performs a simple function, such as emitting a recorded message, projecting an image, or producing a small burst of elemental energy (such as a spark or puff of air). The device ceases to function after 24 hours (unless you spend another hour repairing it).

**Aether Step:** As a bonus action, you can momentarily phase into the Aether, a parallel dimension of pure elemental energy and advanced technology. You can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

**Elemental Surge:** Starting at 3rd level, you can channel your elemental affinity to unleash a powerful surge. As an action, you can cause one of the following effects, depending on your chosen affinity:

- **Air:** You create a powerful gust of wind in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier) or be pushed 15 feet away from you and knocked prone.
- **Earth:** You cause the ground in a 20-foot radius centered on you to become difficult terrain for 1 minute. Each creature of your choice in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier) or be restrained by entangling roots or shifting earth.
- **Fire:** You unleash a burst of flames in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the cone must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier), taking 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that arenâ€™t being worn or carried.
- **Water:** You create a torrent of water in a 20-foot radius centered on you. Each creature of your choice in the area must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier) or be knocked prone. The area becomes lightly obscured by mist for 1 minute.

Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

#### Culture and Society

Aetherborn society is diverse and multifaceted, reflecting their unique blend of elemental magic and advanced technology. They often live in enclaves scattered throughout the Shattered Archipelago, integrating seamlessly into the various cultures while maintaining their own traditions. Aetherborn are known for their deep sense of duty to maintain the balance of elemental forces and their aptitude for innovation and invention.

**Aetheric Guilds:** Many Aetherborn belong to specialized guilds that focus on different aspects of their heritage, such as elemental manipulation, technological innovation, or the preservation of ancient knowledge. These guilds serve as centers of learning and community for Aetherborn and often collaborate with other races and factions across the archipelago.

**Elemental Festivals:** Aetherborn celebrate several unique festivals that honor their elemental heritage. These festivals are marked by displays of magical prowess, technological exhibitions, and communal rituals designed to strengthen the bond between the Aetherborn and the elemental forces.

**Elder Councils:** Each Aetherborn enclave is typically governed by a council of elders, who are revered for their wisdom and experience. These councils make decisions that affect the community and ensure that the Aetherborn uphold their responsibility to the balance of the archipelago.
